# Tic-Tac-Toe Game

## Introduction

This Python program is a simple implementation of the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game. The game is played on a 3x3 board where two players, "you" (the user) and "me" (the computer), take turns to mark the cells with "O" and "X" respectively. The objective is to place three of your marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row to win the game.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x

## How to Run

1. Save the code in a file, for example, `tic_tac_toe.py`.
2. Open a terminal or command prompt.
3. Navigate to the directory where the file is saved.
4. Run the command: `python tic_tac_toe.py`.
